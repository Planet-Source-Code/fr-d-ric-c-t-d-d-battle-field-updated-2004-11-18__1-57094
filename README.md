### Description

My DM wanted a small program to simulate a battle field and display it on his big screen TV when we play. The form is about 1024x768 because his video card is able to display at that resolution on a TV. Players are represented by circles and monsters by triangles. Each players and monsters have a number to make it easy to track them. You can drag the characters where you want. Right-clicking a character toggles between healthy, wounded and dead. Left-clicking and draging on the grid allows you to draw (wall, obstacles, etc). Right-clicking on the grid is the eraser tool. I only implemented medium and large characters because other sizes are rare.

-- Updated 2004-11-16, added an icon for the eraser. -- Updated 2004-11-18, added different colors to be selected for line drawing.

Comments and votes are welcome :)
